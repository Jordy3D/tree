# tree

Ready-to-use JSON-based tree of links for use in bios, descriptions, etc.

## About

This project is designed to make collecting together links to projects, socials, etc. easier.  
The HTML and CSS are designed to be as minimal as possible, so that you can easily add your own styling.  

## Usage

To use this, either click on the Use This Template button, or fork the repository.  
AFter that, you can edit the `tree.json` file to add your own links.  
You can also edit the `index.html` file and/or the `style.css` file to add your own styling.  

## Attribution  

Inspired somewhat by Linktree, though it's not exactly like a list of links in one place is all that unique.  
I'd appreciate it if you left the link to this repository in the footer, but you don't strictly have to.
